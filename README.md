# Return-Type
A basic cpp code while describing Return Type

### Title: Data types

### Aim: To learn different data types and their return values

### Theory:
- There are different types in C++.
- Different data types return different types of values.
- All variables use data type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored.
- Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data they can store.
- Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is 
  declared.
- Every data type requires a different amount of memory.
- C++ supports a wide variety of data types and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the application.
- Data types specify the size and types of values to be stored.
- Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables.
-  example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Types: Integer Character Boolean Floating Point Double Floating Point Valueless or Void Long 
   Double Long Algorithm:

- Start => declare variables along with their data types => declare different variables with different data types such as int, float, char 
  etc. => take valid input of each variable => then print those inputs of those variablesif they are valid and corresponding to the - 
  declared data types => End

## Explanation of the algorithm:

We declare different variables with different data types. Then take valid inputs of those variables. Then print those inputs only if those are valid inputs corresponding to the data types.
